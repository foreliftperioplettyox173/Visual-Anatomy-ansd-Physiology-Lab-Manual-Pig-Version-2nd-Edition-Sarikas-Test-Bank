* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0134626918
  * * Author:  Stephen N. Sarikas
   
  * Visual Anatomy & Physiology Lab Manual (Stephen Sarikas) brings all of the strengths of the revolutionary Visual Anatomy & Physiology textbook (Martini/Ober/Nath/Bartholomew/Petti) to the lab. The 2nd Edition builds upon the visual approach and modular organization with new features to better prepare students for lab, maximize their learning, and reinforce important concepts. With an emphasis on clear, easy to follow figures (from the Martini Visual A&P text),frequent practice, and helping students make connections, the manual provides students with the powerful tools they need to excel.
 
  * The two-page lab activity modules seamlessly integrate text and visuals to guide students through lab activities–with no page flipping. Lab practice consists of hands-on activities and assignable content in Mastering™ A&P, including new pre-lab quizzes, Review Sheets, and virtual lab study tools.
